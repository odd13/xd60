![Default Keymap for XD60](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/1713761720/TB2K0gTalPxQeBjy1XcXXXHzVXa_!!1713761720.png)

I have added layers to allow the olders games that use arrow keys as movement to a standard `wasd` and the ability to switch back to the normal base layer.
## Additional Notes
Default Keymap for XD60 as indicated on the original sale page.

## Build
To build the default keymap, simply run `make xd60-default`.
